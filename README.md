# Mobile Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of mobile phones using various features such as brand, model, specifications, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a mobile phone based on its attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various mobile phones, including:
- Brand
- Model
- RAM
- Internal Storage
- Screen Size
- Battery Capacity
- Camera Quality
- Processor
- Operating System
- Price (target variable)

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `mobile_price.xls/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and model evaluation results.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
